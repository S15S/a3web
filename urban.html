            <p>  It can handle the management and organization of the many different types of data that are involved with the planning process into
                 one place where planners can easily search for them using spatial queries.

            <p>
                This data can then be manipulated for a variety of purposes that are involved with the planning process. It can be used for spatial analysis 
                purposes such as site suitability analysis. It can also be used to create visualizations in the form of maps or graphs to represent this data
                to end up with a clear vision of what is to be done throughout the life span of a project.
