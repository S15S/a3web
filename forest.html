            <p> Forests have been and will continue to be an extremely valueable resource for the world's populations.  Not only in the tactile wood that is produced, but also by providing space for recreational activities for humans.  Spending time in nature has been proven to improve the mental health and well=being in humans and because of this, forests are now more important than ever.  GIS is a valuable tool that allows 
                for forests to be seen, managed and monitored to be conserved and preserved for the many years to come.
